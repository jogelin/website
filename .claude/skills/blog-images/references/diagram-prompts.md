# Diagram Prompt Examples

Ready-to-use prompts for common diagram types in blog articles.

## Key Principles

1. **Light backgrounds** - Always use light/white backgrounds
2. **Simple blocks** - Rounded rectangles with icons and labels
3. **No complex connections** - Avoid tangled lines between blocks
4. **Group by color** - Use different colors for different categories
5. **Muted colors** - Soft teal, slate blue, gentle purple
6. **Professional style** - Corporate presentation aesthetic

## Simple Block Diagrams

### Components Grid (Grouped by Row)

```
A simple diagram with [N] components organized in [M] rows.
Top row: [Component A], [Component B], [Component C] - each as simple rounded rectangles in muted teal color.
Bottom row: [Component D], [Component E], [Component F] - each as simple rounded rectangles in soft purple color.
Each block has an icon and label only. No group titles, no connections between blocks.
Clean grid layout. Light background, soft shadows, professional corporate style.
```

### AI Framework Components Example

```
A simple diagram with 7 AI Framework components in 2 rows.
Top row: Agents (robot icon), Skills (book icon), MCPs (plug icon) - 3 simple rounded rectangles in muted teal color.
Bottom row: Prompts (speech bubble icon), Templates (document icon), Rules (checklist icon), Examples (code brackets icon) - 4 simple rounded rectangles in soft purple color.
Each block has an icon and label only. No group titles, no connections between blocks.
Clean grid layout. Light background, soft shadows, professional corporate style.
```

## Cycle Diagrams

### Migration/Lifecycle Cycle

```
Circular diagram showing a repeating cycle with 5 steps connected by arrows.
Steps arranged in a circle: "Build New Framework" → "Start Migration" → "Slow Adoption" → "New Technologies" → "Try Again" → back to start.
Each step as a rounded rectangle with a small icon. Gray arrows connecting each step.
Light background, muted slate blue for blocks, soft shadows.
Professional corporate presentation style.
```

### Feedback Loop

```
Continuous loop diagram with 4 connected nodes.
Nodes: "Measure" → "Analyze" → "Improve" → "Deploy" → back to "Measure".
Circular flow with curved gray arrows connecting each step.
Light background, muted teal blocks, soft shadows.
Clean, minimalist style.
```

## Layer/Stack Diagrams

### Three-Layer Stack (DX/AI/Foundations)

```
Three horizontal layers stacked vertically.
Top layer: Soft yellow/amber tint, label "Developer Experience" with tags [Specify, Develop, Validate, Maintain].
Middle layer: Soft purple tint, label "AI Orchestration" with tags [AI Tooling, AI Framework].
Bottom layer: Soft cyan/teal tint, label "Engineering Foundations" with tags [Codebase, Architecture, Design System].
Subtle separation between layers. Light background.
Clean, professional presentation style.
```

### Maturity Levels

```
4 horizontal bars showing progression from bottom to top.
Level 1 (bottom): "Autocomplete" - smallest bar, light gray
Level 2: "Chat-Driven" - slightly larger, soft blue
Level 3: "Agentic" - larger, soft purple
Level 4 (top): "Orchestration" - largest bar, muted teal highlight
Light background, ascending arrow on the side.
Professional corporate style, soft shadows.
```

## Hub & Spoke Diagrams

### Central Hub with Connections

```
A hub diagram showing [Central Element] as a central hexagon in the middle.
Radiating connections to: Left side shows [Category A items] as rounded rectangles.
Right side shows [Category B items] as rounded rectangles.
Clean connecting lines from center to all elements.
Use muted teal for center, soft slate blue for left items, soft purple for right items.
Light background, professional corporate presentation style.
```

## Flow Diagrams

### Linear Process Flow

```
Horizontal flow diagram with 5 connected rectangles.
"Idea" → "Spec" → "Implementation" → "Validation" → "Release"
Gray arrows connecting each step, left to right.
Light background, muted teal blocks, dark gray text.
Clean, modern flowchart style with soft shadows.
```

### SDLC Phases

```
Circular or semi-circular diagram showing 6 software lifecycle phases.
Phases arranged in order: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Validation → Release → Evolution
Central element: "AI Framework" connecting to all phases with subtle lines.
Each phase as a rounded rectangle with muted color.
Light background, professional corporate style.
```

## Comparison Diagrams

### Before/After (Side by Side)

```
Split diagram: left side "Before", right side "After".
Left: Simple blocks showing manual/complex process, soft amber/gray tones
Right: Clean organized blocks showing AI-assisted process, muted teal tones
Dividing line in center, labels at top.
Light background, clear contrast between sides.
Professional presentation style.
```

### Generic vs Contextualized

```
Two columns side by side on light background.
Left column: "Generic AI" - 4 simple blocks in gray
Right column: "Contextualized AI" - 4 simple blocks in muted teal
Checkmarks in teal on right side items.
Clean table-like layout, soft shadows on blocks.
Professional corporate style.
```

## Effect Diagrams

### Compound Effect

```
A diagram showing compound effect of investments.
Left side: Small inputs (prompt, skill, rule) as small blocks
Center: "AI Framework" as central block
Right side: Multiple larger outputs (code gen, reviews, support) as blocks
Show multiplication/growth effect with fanning arrows.
Muted teal and soft purple accents. Light background, professional style.
```

## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Always specify "light background"** - Default to white/light gray
2. **Use "simple rounded rectangles"** - Keep shapes basic
3. **Include "icon and label"** - Visual + text for each element
4. **Specify colors by category** - "muted teal for X, soft purple for Y"
5. **Add "no connections" or "clean connections"** - Avoid tangled diagrams
6. **End with "professional corporate presentation style"** - Ensures clean output
7. **Mention "soft shadows"** - Adds depth without glow effects
