## **\[🌊 Nx Core\]**

### **Dependency Only Target**

In your project configuration, you can now declare a target with only the `dependsOn` property:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets:": {
    "my-target":{
      "dependsOn": ["..."]
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can group the execution of many different targets into a single one without having to use the `nx:command` executor:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets:": {
    "test":{
      "dependsOn": ["integration-test", "unit-test"]
    },
    "integration-test":{
      "executor": "..."
      "dependsOn": ["targets-deps"]
    },
    "unit-test":{
      "executor": "..."
      "dependsOn": ["targets-deps"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also simplify the duplication of the `dependsOn` configurations by grouping it into a single target:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "targets:": {
    "before-build":{
      "dependsOn": ["^openapi-generation", "..."]
    },
    "build":{
      "executor": "..."
      "dependsOn": ["before-build"]
    },
    "serve":{
      "executor": "..."
      "dependsOn": ["before-build"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Ability to split long Nx single command**

If you are using the `nx:run-commands` executor with a long command like:

```json
"start-dev": {
  "executor": "nx:run-commands",
  "options": {
    "command": "docker compose -f .docker/compose/docker-compose.services.yml -f .docker/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up -d"
  }
}
```

You can now make your configuration more readable by splitting it:

```json
"start-dev": {
  "executor": "nx:run-commands",
  "options": {
    "command": [
      "docker compose -f",
      ".docker/compose/docker-compose.services.yml -f",
      ".docker/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml",
      "--project-directory . up -d"
    ]
  }
},
```

## **\[🧩 Plugins\]**

### **Add View Provider utility for Angular component**

If you were adding the `viewProviders` configuration in your custom Angular component generators, you replace that code now with the new utility `addViewProviderToComponent`:

### **Support Composite Build for Gradle**

Nx continues the Gradle support by including more features such as the [Composite Builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/composite_builds.html):

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*svPPaGYe2kPfSbSh.png)

Composite builds allow you to:

* Combine builds that are usually developed independently, for instance, when trying out a bug fix in a library that your application uses.
    
* Decompose a large multi-project build into smaller, more isolated chunks that can be worked on independently or together as needed.

### **Convert to Inferred Generators**

On the [release blog related to Nx v19](/blog/cherry-picked-nx-v19-updates#heading-add-generators-to-convert-projects-to-inferred-targets), I talked about the `convert-to-inferred` generator for:

```bash
nx g @nx/eslint:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/playwright:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/cypress:convert-to-inferred
```

These generators will remove the configurations from your `project.json` that are covered by Nx plugins.

Now you can also use that generator on many other plugins:

```bash
nx g @nx/vite:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/webpack:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/jest:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/storybook:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/remix:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/rollup:convert-to-inferred
nx g @nx/next:convert-to-inferred
```

⚠️ If you want to use `@nx/webpack:convert-to-inferred`, you’ll first need to migrate to the [`NxWebpackPlugin`](https://nx.dev/recipes/webpack/webpack-plugins#nxwebpackplugin) [(see below).](https://nx.dev/recipes/webpack/webpack-plugins#nxwebpackplugin)

Also, if you want to run the generators based on the installed plugins, you can use the command:

```bash
npx nx g convert-to-inferred
? Which generator would you like to use? …
  @nx/cypress:convert-to-inferred
  @nx/eslint:convert-to-inferred
  ...
```

> If you don’t know what inference means, please read my article [💎 Discovering Nx Project Crystal’s Magic](/blog/discovering-nx-project-crystals-magic).

### **Convert to Webpack Plugin**

If you are using [custom Wepack configurations](https://nx.dev/recipes/webpack/webpack-config-setup), I recommend having a look at the generator:

```bash
nx g @nx/webpack:convert-config-to-webpack-plugin
```

This generator will convert `withNx` Webpack config to a standard config using [`NxWebpackPlugin`](https://nx.dev/recipes/webpack/webpack-plugins#nxwebpackplugin) which is in charge of injecting Nx configurations like TypeScript support and links to workspace libraries (via tsconfig paths).
