# Positioning

## Title

**Developer Experience Architect | AI Tooling & Nx Expert**

## Tagline

Designing scalable software systems and developer workflows

## Value Proposition

I help teams align architecture, tooling, and practices using Nx, strong conventions, and AI-assisted automation.

## The Problem I Solve

Engineering teams at scale face:
- Fragmented repositories with inconsistent workflows
- Slow CI/CD pipelines that waste developer time
- Lack of architectural governance across codebases
- Difficulty scaling development practices across teams
- Manual, repetitive tasks that could be automated

## My Approach

1. **Architecture-first:** Design systems that scale with the organization
2. **Conventions over documentation:** Encode best practices into tooling
3. **AI as amplifier:** Use AI to enforce conventions, not replace structure
4. **Practical enablement:** Coach teams to own and evolve the system

## Differentiators

1. **Deep Nx expertise** - Champion & Expert certifications, custom plugin development
2. **Polyglot experience** - Java, TypeScript, Python, Go, .NET unified under one build system
3. **AI-augmented approach** - Architecture-aware AI, not generic AI consulting
4. **Enterprise track record** - Julius Baer, Caseware, Entain, Selligent, Thalys, SWIFT
5. **Coach + Builder** - Both implement solutions and enable teams to maintain them

## Target Audience

- Engineering teams at scale (50+ developers)
- Organizations with distributed/fragmented repositories
- Companies migrating to monorepo architecture
- Teams seeking CI/CD optimization and developer experience improvement
- Organizations exploring architecture-aware AI tooling

## What I'm NOT

- Generic AI consultant
- One-time contractor who leaves without knowledge transfer
- Tool evangelist pushing specific tech regardless of fit
- Consultant who only advises without implementing
