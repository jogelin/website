## Primary Headlines

### Main Headline
Designing scalable software systems and developer workflows

### Supporting Statement
I help teams align architecture, tooling, and practices using Nx, strong conventions, and AI-assisted automation

## Elevator Pitches

### 30-second
I'm a Developer Experience Architect specializing in Nx and AI tooling. I help enterprise teams unify their development workflows, optimize CI/CD, and introduce architecture-aware AI that actually understands their codebase. My recent work includes building polyglot build systems at Julius Baer and optimizing a 900-project monorepo at Caseware.

### 10-second
I design scalable developer workflows using Nx monorepos and AI-assisted automation.

### One-liner
Developer Experience Architect helping teams scale with Nx and architecture-aware AI.

## Value Slider Content (6 slides)

### 1. Architectural Direction & Alignment
Establish clear architectural boundaries and align teams around shared conventions. Define what belongs where, and make it enforceable.

### 2. Unified Development Workflows
Standardize build, test, and deployment processes across diverse tech stacks. One way of working, regardless of language or framework.

### 3. Scalable Software Architectures
Design modular systems that grow with your organization. Micro-frontends, bounded contexts, and clear ownership models.

### 4. Quality and Governance
Enforce standards through automated checks and self-service tooling. Quality gates that don't slow teams down.

### 5. Nx as Backbone
Leverage Nx monorepos for intelligent task orchestration, caching, and dependency management. The foundation for scalable development.

### 6. AI-Augmented Tooling
Integrate Claude Code plugins for architecture-aware development assistance. AI that respects your conventions and amplifies your practices.
