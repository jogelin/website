# Services

## Service Pillars

### 1. Architecture & Workflow Audits

Review current architecture, CI/CD, and development workflows. Identify bottlenecks, inconsistencies, and unification opportunities. Deliver actionable roadmap with clear priorities.

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture assessment report
- Workflow bottleneck analysis
- Prioritized improvement roadmap
- Quick wins vs. strategic investments

**Typical duration:** 2-4 weeks

### 2. Nx & Platform Enablement

Implement or optimize Nx across polyglot stacks. Build custom plugins, configure distributed caching and task execution, establish conventions that scale.

**Capabilities:**
- Greenfield monorepo setup
- Multi-repo to monorepo migration
- Custom Nx plugin development (generators, executors, inference)
- Distributed Task Execution (DTE) configuration
- Remote caching setup (Nx Cloud, custom)
- Polyglot integration (Java, Go, Python, .NET alongside JavaScript/TypeScript)

**Example outcomes:**
- 10x faster CI through intelligent caching
- Unified workflows across 900+ projects (Caseware)
- Polyglot build system across Java, Go, Helm, Python, npm (Julius Baer)

---

### 3. Developer Experience & Governance

Define and enforce development standards through tooling, not documentation. Create generators, ESLint rules, and CI checks. Empower teams through training and pairing.

**Capabilities:**
- Code generators for consistent project scaffolding
- Architectural boundary enforcement
- Automated code quality gates
- Developer onboarding automation
- Team coaching and pair programming
- Workshop facilitation

**Philosophy:** Conventions encoded as code, not wiki pages that become outdated.

### 4. AI-Augmented Engineering

Integrate architecture-aware AI tooling via Claude Code plugins. Enable smarter code analysis, architecture validation, and automated workflows that respect your conventions.

**Capabilities:**
- Custom Claude Code plugin development
- AI agents aligned with codebase conventions
- Architecture validation during code review
- Intelligent task recommendations based on project graph
- Safe AI adoption strategies for large codebases

**Differentiator:** Not generic AI consulting. Tools that work within established conventions, amplifying developer productivity while respecting architectural decisions.
